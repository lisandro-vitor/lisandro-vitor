### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Lisandro, I'm from the interior of SP, an Office Assistant and, currently, I'm in a career transition to programming.

I am passionate about technological challenges and am constantly looking for learning in the area of â€‹â€‹software development. Currently in training, I look for opportunities to apply my knowledge and contribute to innovative projects.

I have experience in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Although the front-end is my niche of expertise and specialization, I am also on the path to becoming full stack.
